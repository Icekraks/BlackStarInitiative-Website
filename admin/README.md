## Development

Make sure you provide an .env, there is an example of it with all the fields that need to be filled out.

From your terminal:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

```sh
pnpm deploy
```

You will need to deploy the admin to the live CMS. Only do this when absolutely sure and you wont delete fields.
